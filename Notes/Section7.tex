\begin{itemize}

  \item Heat ($Q$) and Work ($W$)

    \begin{itemize}

      \item $Q$ is the energy transferred \underline{to} $S$ through thermal contact with $R$

      \item $W$ is work done by/on $S$ through change in volume or external fields

    \end{itemize}

  \item \nth{1} Law of Thermodynamics

    $$\delta Q = dU+ \delta W$$

    \begin{itemize}

      \item $\delta$ is the inexact differential

      \item This means that:

        $$\oint df=0\text{ or }\int_1^2 df=\int_1^2 df$$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item $df$ is independent of path

        \end{itemize}

        $$\oint\partial f\neq0\text{ and }\int_1^2\partial f\text{ is path dependent}$$

      \item Note it \textit{may} equal 0, but does not have to

    \end{itemize}

  \item $U,\sigma$ are state functions, as they depend on state variables only ($\tau,V,N,\ldots$)

    \begin{itemize}

      \item $Q,W$ are not state functions (\textit{i}.\textit{e}.\ they are dependent on path)

    \end{itemize}

  \item Let us consider a reversible process â€” a process that does not increase the total entropy of $S+R$

    $$\delta Q_{rev}=\tau d\sigma$$

    \begin{itemize}

      \item In general:

        $$\delta Q\leq \tau d\sigma$$

      \item $Q$ is low quality energy; adding $\delta Q$ to $S$ increases its entropy by $\delta Q/\tau$

      \item $W$ is high quality energy

      \item Heat engines convert heat to work

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Steam engine
            
          \item Internal combustion

          \item Power plant

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Carnot efficiency $\eta_c$, is the ratio o work generate by $S$ to heat added to $S$ in a reversible process

    $$\eta_c=\left( \frac{W}{Q_h} \right)_{rev}$$

    \begin{itemize}

      \item This can be rewritten in many forms, including:

        $$\eta_c=\frac{Q_h-Q_l}{Q_h}=1-\frac{Q_l}{Q_h}=1-\frac{\tau_l}{\tau_h}$$

      \item The actual efficiency is:

        $$\eta\leq\eta_c$$

      \item This can be obtained by assuming $\sigma_h\leq\sigma_l$

    \end{itemize}

  \item Refrigerators use work to move heat

    \begin{itemize}

      \item The Carnot efficiency for a refrigerator is:

        $$\gamma_c=\left( \frac{Q_l}{W} \right)_{rev}$$

      \item This can be expressed in more useful terms for us as:

        $$\gamma_c=\frac{\tau_l}{\tau_h-\tau_l}$$

      \item Similar to heat engines, we can say:

        $$\gamma\leq\gamma_c$$

    \end{itemize}

  \item Carnot Cycle

    \begin{itemize}

      \item $1\to2$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item $Q_{12}=\tau_h(\sigma_h-\sigma_l)>0$

          \item $W_{12}=\tau_h(\sigma_h-\sigma_l)-(U_2-U_1)$

        \end{itemize}

      \item $2\to3$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item $Q_{23}=0$

          \item $W_{23}=-(U_3-U_2)$

        \end{itemize}

      \item $3\to4$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item $Q_{34}=\tau_l(\sigma_l-\sigma_h)<0$

          \item $W_{34}=\tau_l(\sigma_l-\sigma_h)-(U_4-U_3)$

        \end{itemize}

      \item $4\to1$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item $Q_{41}=0$

          \item $W_{41}=-(U_1-U_4)$

        \end{itemize}

      \item Total

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Work: $$(\tau_h-\tau_l)(\sigma_h-\sigma_l)>0$$

          \item Heat: $$(\tau_h-\tau_l)(\sigma_h-\sigma_l)>0$$

        \end{itemize}

      \item The efficiency may be defined as:

        $$\eta=\frac{W_{tot}}{Q_{rec}}=1-\frac{\tau_l}{\tau_h}$$

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
