\begin{itemize}

  \item Heat ($Q$) and Work ($W$)

    \begin{itemize}

      \item $Q$ is the energy transferred \underline{to} $S$ through thermal contact with $R$

      \item $W$ is work done by/on $S$ through change in volume or external fields

    \end{itemize}

  \item \nth{1} Law of Thermodynamics

    $$\delta Q = dU+ \delta W$$

    \begin{itemize}

      \item $\delta$ is the inexact differential

      \item This means that:

        $$\oint df=0\text{ or }\int_1^2 df=\int_1^2 df$$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item $df$ is independent of path

        \end{itemize}

        $$\oint\partial f\neq0\text{ and }\int_1^2\partial f\text{ is path dependent}$$

      \item Note it \textit{may} equal 0, but does not have to

    \end{itemize}

  \item $U,\sigma$ are state functions, as they depend on state variables only ($\tau,V,N,\ldots$)

    \begin{itemize}

      \item $Q,W$ are not state functions (\textit{i}.\textit{e}.\ they are dependent on path)

    \end{itemize}

  \item Let us consider a reversible process â€” a process that does not increase the total entropy of $S+R$

    $$\delta Q_{rev}=\tau d\sigma$$

    \begin{itemize}

      \item In general:

        $$\delta Q\leq \tau d\sigma$$

      \item $Q$ is low quality energy; adding $\delta Q$ to $S$ increases its entropy by $\delta Q/\tau$

      \item $W$ is high quality energy

      \item Heat engines convert heat to work

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Steam engine
            
          \item Internal combustion

          \item Power plant

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Carnot efficiency $\eta_c$, is the ratio o work generate by $S$ to heat added to $S$ in a reversible process

    $$\eta_c=\left( \frac{W}{Q_h} \right)_{rev}$$

    \begin{itemize}

      \item This can be rewritten in many forms, including:

        $$\eta_c=\frac{Q_h-Q_l}{Q_h}=1-\frac{Q_l}{Q_h}=1-\frac{\tau_l}{\tau_h}$$

      \item The actual efficiency is:

        $$\eta\leq\eta_c$$

      \item This can be obtained by assuming $\sigma_h\leq\sigma_l$

    \end{itemize}

  \item Refrigerators use work to move heat

    \begin{itemize}

      \item The Carnot efficiency for a refrigerator is:

        $$\gamma_c=\left( \frac{Q_l}{W} \right)_{rev}$$

      \item This can be expressed in more useful terms for us as:

        $$\gamma_c=\frac{\tau_l}{\tau_h-\tau_l}$$

      \item Similar to heat engines, we can say:

        $$\gamma\leq\gamma_c$$

    \end{itemize}

  \item Carnot Cycle

      \label{fig:1}
    \end{figure}

    \begin{itemize}

      \item $1\to2$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item $Q_{12}=\tau_h(\sigma_h-\sigma_l)>0$

          \item $W_{12}=\tau_h(\sigma_h-\sigma_l)-(U_2-U_1)$

        \end{itemize}

      \item $2\to3$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item $Q_{23}=0$

          \item $W_{23}=-(U_3-U_2)$

        \end{itemize}

      \item $3\to4$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item $Q_{34}=\tau_l(\sigma_l-\sigma_h)<0$

          \item $W_{34}=\tau_l(\sigma_l-\sigma_h)-(U_4-U_3)$

        \end{itemize}

      \item $4\to1$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item $Q_{41}=0$

          \item $W_{41}=-(U_1-U_4)$

        \end{itemize}

      \item Total

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Work: $$(\tau_h-\tau_l)(\sigma_h-\sigma_l)>0$$

          \item Heat: $$(\tau_h-\tau_l)(\sigma_h-\sigma_l)>0$$

        \end{itemize}

      \item The efficiency may be defined as:

        $$\eta=\frac{W_{tot}}{Q_{rec}}=1-\frac{\tau_l}{\tau_h}$$

    \end{itemize}

  \item Subtle difference between isentropic and adiabatic (same if reversible): isentropic means constant entropy, adiabatic means no heat added to the system

  \item Carnot Cycle for an Ideal Gas (Spin 0, monatomic)

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Process $1\to2$ (Isothermal Expansion)

        \begin{itemize}

          \item $Q_{12}=\tau_h(\sigma_2-\sigma_1)=\tau_hN\ln\left( \frac{V_2}{V_1} \right)>0$

          \item $W_{12}=Q_{12}$ (from the $\delta Q=dU + \delta W$)

        \end{itemize}

      \item Process $2\to3$ (Isentropic/Adiabatic\footnote{Note; we may use either because the process is reversible} Expansion)

        \begin{itemize}

          \item $Q_{23}=0$

          \item $W_{23}=-\Delta U=-(U_3-U_2)=\frac{3N}{2}(\tau_h-\tau_l) >0$

        \end{itemize}

      \item Process $3\to4$ (Isothermal Contraction)

        \begin{itemize}

          \item $Q_{34}=\tau_lN\ln\left( \frac{V_4}{V_3} \right)=\tau_lN\ln\left( \frac{V_1}{V_2} \right)<0$

          \item $W_{34}=Q_{34}$

        \end{itemize}

      \item Process $4\to1$ (Isentropic Contraction)

        \begin{itemize}

          \item $Q_{41}=0$

          \item $W_{41}=-\Delta U=-\left( U_1-U_4 \right)-\frac{3N}{2}\left( \tau_l-\tau_h \right)<0$

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Work done by a reversible proess:

    $$\delta W=\tau\,d\sigma-dU$$

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Isothermal Process

        \begin{itemize}

            $$\delta W=-d(U-\tau\sigma)$$
            $$F=U-\tau\sigma$$

          \item This gives us:

            $$\delta W=-dF$$
            $$W=-\Delta F$$

          \item The work done by $S$ in a reversible, isothermal process is $-\Delta F$; $W<-\Delta F$ if the process is irreversible

          \item Thus, we can say the maximum work done by $S$ in any process at constant temperature is $\Delta F$

        \end{itemize}

      \item Isobaric Process

        \begin{itemize}

          \item The Work done by $S$ on the the environment is $P\,dV$, which is not very useful

          \item The effective work can be written:

            $$\delta W'=\tau\,d\sigma-dU-P\,dV$$

            \begin{itemize}

              \item Under constant temperature:

                $$\delta W'=-d\left( U+PV-\tau\sigma \right)$$

              \item We can introduce another quantity, $G$, the Gibbs free energy, such that:

                $$\delta W'=-dG$$
                $$W'=-\Delta G$$

              \item Similar statements for the Gibbs free energy can be made: $W_{eff}=-\Delta G$ for a reversible process, and $W_{eff}<-\Delta G$ for an irreversible process

              \item The enthalpy is $H=U+PV$

              \item Considering a case where $\delta W'=0$ (no effective work is done):

                $$\delta Q=d(U+PV)$$
                $$Q=\Delta H$$

            \end{itemize}

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
