    \begin{enumerate}

      \item 

        First and foremost, we know:

        $$Q_h=Q_l+W$$
        $$W=Q_l-Q_h$$

        Per reversible conditions:

        $$\sigma_h=\sigma_l$$
        $$\frac{Q_h}{\tau_h}=\frac{Q_l}{\tau_l}$$
        $$Q_h=\frac{\tau_hQ_l}{\tau_l}$$

        Thus, we can combine to write:

        $$W=Q_h-\frac{\tau_l}{\tau_h}Q_h$$
        $$W=Q_h\left( 1-\frac{\tau_l}{\tau_h}\right)$$
        $$W=Q_h\left( \frac{\tau_h-\tau_l}{\tau_h}\right)$$

        And finally:

        $$\boxed{\frac{W}{Q_h}=\frac{\tau_h-\tau_l}{\tau_h}}$$

        If the heat pump is not reversible, we know the efficiency is:

        $$\frac{W}{Q_h}<\frac{\tau_h-\tau_l}{\tau_h}$$

  \item

    First and foremost, we may write:

    $$W=(\tau_h-\tau_l)\sigma_l$$

    Given the assumption that the process is reversible, we may write:

    $$\sigma_l=\frac{Q_l}{\tau_l}$$

    This gives us:

    $$W=\left( \frac{\tau_h}{\tau_l}-1 \right)Q_l$$

    We can apply the given parameters to find:

    $$W=\left( \frac{500}{20}-1 \right)1500$$
    $$\boxed{W=36[\si{\giga\watt}]}$$

    Given improvements, we can write:

    $$W=\left( \frac{600}{20}-1 \right)1500$$
    $$\boxed{W=43.5[\si{\giga\watt}]}$$

    Clearly, there is nearly a 20\% increase in the ability to produce energy

  \item

    We know from (1) that:

    $$\frac{W}{Q_l}=\left( \frac{\tau_h}{\tau_l}-1 \right)$$

    And also that:

    $$W+Q_l=Q_h$$

    We can express the work done by the light bulb as $W=Q_l$. The total work of the two processes needs to equal zero, which allows us to write:

    $$\left( \frac{\tau_h}{\tau_l}=1 \right)Q_l-Q_l=0$$

    This simplifies to:

    $$\tau_h=2\tau_l$$

\end{enumerate}
